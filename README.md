**AutoTrendyKeywords process**: <br>

### Why AutoTrendyKeywords:
- Keywords are essential for SEO to optimize the content for search engines.
- Keywords are decided based on trends when the content is created.
- Trends change frequently, and manual keyword generation may not be up-to-date.
- Manual keyword generation is time-consuming and requires expertise.
- The project uses LLMs to generate real-time SEO keywords based on trends, saving time and resources.
- The project embeds the keywords in the HTML code for better SEO optimization.

An experiment was conducted by writing a blog on my last project [LML-DAP](https://github.com/Pro-GenAI/LML-DAP).
Results below shows the keywords that were trending.
